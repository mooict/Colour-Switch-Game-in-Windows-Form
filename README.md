# C# Tutorial â€“ Create a simple Color Switch game in Visual Studio

In this tutorial I will demonstrate how to make a simple colour switch game using only windows form and C# programming language. This game was a lot of fun to make and I think its beneficial for beginner programmers to sort of think outside the box and make something that is fun and simple. 

We are using Windows Form .Net Framework for this game and we will use only C# programming to make this, we aren't using any third party libraries for this game so you can simply load up visual studio and start following the tutorial from this video. There is a written version of this game can be found on the MOO ICT Website, where you can follow along but if you prefer video tutorials then sick around to the end and see how you do. 

This game will make use of several components for Windows Form such as Panel, List Box, Picture boxes, Labels and Timer. We will not just make a game to play but also to store the score of this game into the list box and show the time when we have scored it. Noice. 

Hope you find this video useful and happy programming.
